# Aircraft-Seat-Allocation-System

This C program can read passengers' data from [WithReserve.dat](/WithReserve.dat/) and [NoReserve.dat](/NoReserve.dat/) and allocate the seats in Airbus A320 accordingly with minimized moment in both X and Y direction as shown in figure below. The passengers' weight data in .dat files are utilized to calculate the moment of the A320 aircraft. The output of the program will be in .csv file with the title of [PassengerList.csv](/PassengerList.csv/).

Both the .dat files and the code can be modified to suit different needs.

A more detailed description of the task is available in [DETAILED_EXPLANATION.md](/DETAILED_EXPLANATION.md/).
